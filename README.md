# edn

A Rust implementation of the [edn serialization](https://github.com/edn-format/edn). The current focus is on modeling and parsing Edn, but will later include serializing to Edn.

*WARNING*: The implementation is not yet complete, and the API is unstable.

See the `TODO` comments in the source to get a sense of what features are missing.
